When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I want to keep my repository in cloud for sharing and collaboration and also can access from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	as if git pull automatically then there might be lot's of pull unecessary for changes we don't want to sync, 
	and also if we want to share only some part/version of our code or we want different version at remote repository and at local repository.
