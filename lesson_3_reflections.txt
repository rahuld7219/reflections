When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I want to keep my repository in cloud for sharing and collaboration and also can access from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	as if git pull automatically then there might be lot's of pull unecessary for changes we don't want to sync, 
	and also if we want to share only some part/version of our code or we want different version at remote repository and at local repository.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	clone:to make a copy of a remote repository to our local machine or to make a copy of our local repository locally.
	fork: to copy someone else's github repository to our github.
	branches: to create a different version/path/branch of our local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	so when we get offline we can still be able to comapre the online version with our local version and can merge locally if we want to.
